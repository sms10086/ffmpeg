/**
 * FF_API_* defines may be placed below to indicate public API that will be
 * dropped at a future version bump. The defines themselves are not part of
 * the public API and may change, break or disappear at any time.
 *
 * @note, when bumping the major version it is recommended to manually
 * disable each FF_API_* in its own commit instead of disabling them all
 * at once through the bump. This improves the git bisect-ability of the change.
